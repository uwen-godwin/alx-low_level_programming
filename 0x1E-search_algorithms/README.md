## Introduction
Searching is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used to find elements within a data structure. There are various search algorithms, each with its own advantages and use cases. This repository aims to provide implementations of popular search algorithms to serve as educational resources and practical tools for software development projects.

## Description
The search algorithms implemented in this project include:

- **Linear Search:** A simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until the target element is found or the list is exhausted.
- **Binary Search:** An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate C file along with a header file containing function prototypes.

## Installation
To use these search algorithms in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-algorithms.git
